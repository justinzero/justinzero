### Hey üëã I'm Justin
I enjoy working on audio, lighting, interactive and immersive experiences. My go-to tools at the moment are TouchDesigner, Teensy, ESP32, EagleCAD, VCV Rack, Ableton Live and Platform.io


I currently work at Oregon Museum of Science and Industry designing electronics and code for exhibits. I teach workshops and research new technology at **[CETI](https://ceti.institute/)** in Portland State University. Otherwise I can be found at **[PDX Hackerspace](https://pdxhackerspace.org/)**, making various art projects or weeding the back yard.

I also herd the cats for a community meetup called **[Dorkbot](https://dorkbotpdx.org/)**, in which people who do strange things with electricity (and code) gather to show and tell, as well as socialize [üç∫].
